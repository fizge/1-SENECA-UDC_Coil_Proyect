# Introduction to DataPilot Version 1.0 :chart_with_upwards_trend:
DataPilot uses linear regression models to predict profit values. This tool is designed for retail businesses aiming to: <br>
- Increase yearly profit margins
- Identify data trends
- Analyze data to make informed decisions for a business <br>

You can use your own data models stored as an excel (.xls), data base(.db), or comma separated value (.csv) file to generate data predictions by selecting the independent variables (features) and dependent variables (target) to create a prediction model.

# Getting Started with DataPilot 
Welcome to DataPilot! Before you start using DataPilot and the features designed to simplify data analysis to achieve your business goals, you will need to familiarize yourself with important parts of the interface. This section will help you get started by covering device requirements and introducing DataPilotâ€™s main functions.

## System requirements
DataPilot works on both Mac (macOS) and Windows. The download file varies slightly depending on your operating system, but the interface is the same on both platforms. For detailed device and download requirements, see Table 1.1 below.

## Navigating the DataPilot interfaces
Once you review if your device is compatible, you can download DataPilot to your desktop and start using all of its data analyzing features. DataPilot has three main interfaces that with their own features: 
* Loading a model interface
* Model generating interface
* Graph interface

### Loading a model interface
After you start the application, the loading a model interface appears. On this screen, you can upload your existing data files or load a past DataPilot model with the **Open File** and **Load Model** buttons (See Figure 1 below) To learn more about how to load models, see Opening data files.
