# Trackr Internal Documentation
This documentation provides essential background information for the Trackr project team, covering all foundational details about the
Trackr software and its users. The purpose of this resource is to keep team members informed of the context that guides the project.

## Audience
The intended audience of Trackr are small to medium-scale business owners with low to average technical expertise who want to gain data-based insights that can inform their decisions.  Trackr can be of use to make other industry-specific predictions from users of different professions, such as e-commerce and education.

## What is AI? 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables computers and machines to stimulate human abilities, comprehension, problem solving, and even creativity. AI systems can analyze large amounts of data to recognize patterns and adapt over time, constantly learning and adapting from new data.

## What is Linear Regression? 
Linear regression is a method in data science and machine learning that helps predict future outcomes by finding a straight-line relationship between two variables. The independent variable is the known data, and the dependent variable is what we want to predict. This method can be used to make informed guesses about things like sales, age, housing prices, and product costs. 

### The Linear Regression Model

In simple linear regression, a line is formed based on the data points of the independent and dependent variables. The line consists of two parts:
* A slope - Displays how the dependent variable changes each time there is a change in the independent variable.
* Intercept -This is the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.

The purpose of this line is to make future predictions by showing a clear, straightforward relationship between
the two variables given the data.

### How does Trackr use Linear Regression and AI? 
Trackr allows users to effortlessly create and work with linear regression models, helping businesses predict profits using past data. By uploading an existing spreadsheet to Trackr, users can quickly generate a linear regression model, while AI enhances the results by delivering actionable insights. This process requires minimal effort and no advanced technical knowledge, making data-driven predictions accessible to everyone.
